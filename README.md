# atm
create an ATM example using HTML, CSS, JS


- Just for fun I have implemented a 3 allowed tries procedure. After the 3rd mistaken PIN input your transaction is cancelled.
- Cancel and Back buttons are displayed where it makes sense. For example on screen no.5 (waiting for your money) it makes no sense for these buttons to be displayed.
- Had to create one more screen (no4) where user enters custom amount of money.
- App plays well even on IE9 (without animation of course).
- Have used fontawesome library for the welcome screen icons.
- Code is W3C valid.
- CSS browser prefixes were taken from http://pleeease.io/play. On a public project a CSS preprocessor would have taken care of this.
- Images are shrinked using https://tinypng.com
